<sub>The original Tutorial can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/translation_transformer.html).</sub>

The Transformer, introduced in the paper *[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)* is a Seq2Seq model for solving machine translation tasks.

  This notebook shows:
- How to train a translation model from scratch using Transformer.
- Use torchtext library to access Multi30k dataset to train a German to English translation model.
